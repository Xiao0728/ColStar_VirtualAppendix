# Training 
For Training and Indexing a Col$\star$ model, please follow this [instruction for training](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/blob/main/ColStar_models/Training_CMD.md) and [instruction for indexing](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/blob/main/ColStar_models/index.md).




# Evaluation 

## Reproducibility Experiments

The reproducibility experiments is demonstrated in this [notebook](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/blob/main/Reproducibility%20(RQ1%20Res)/Reproducibility_Demo%20(RQ1%20results).ipynb).
In addition, all the results files are provided under this [folder](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/tree/main/Reproducibility%20(RQ1%20Res))


## Replicability Experiments

The replicability experiments of our paper is demonstrated in this [notebook](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/blob/main/Replicability%20(RQ2%20Res)/Replicability_Demo%20(RQ2%20results).ipynb). Also, all the results files that can be used to reproduce our results are provided in this [folder](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/tree/main/Replicability%20(RQ2%20Res))


## Insights Experiments

For the insights experiments, we also provide a [demo](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/blob/main/Insights%20(RQ3%20Res)/ColStar_SMP_Demo%20(RQ3%20Res).ipynb).
Or, instead of running the experiments from scratch, you can use our provided results files in this [folder](https://github.com/Xiao0728/ColStar/tree/main/Insights%20(RQ3%20Res)) directly to reproduce our presented results.
