# ColStar 

# Training 
For Training and Indexing a Col* model, please follow this [instruction for training](ColStar_models/Training_CMD.md).
The trained checkpoints for the selected Col* models, namely ColBERT-Cosine, ColBERT-L2, ColRoBERTa and ColALBERT, to build the dense index are shared here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S9d1M_5LGcGyC6W15ZOCL6KGGRNc6wXa?usp=sharing

# Indexing

Using your own trained model or our shared checkpoint, you can build the dense index following this [instruction for indexing](ColStar_models/index.md).




# Evaluation 

## Reproducibility Experiments

The reproducibility experiments are demonstrated in this [demo notebook](Reproducibility%20(RQ1%20Res)/Reproducibility_Demo%20(RQ1%20results).ipynb).
In addition, all the results files are provided under this [results folder](Reproducibility%20(RQ1%20Res)/).


## Replicability Experiments

The replicability experiments of our paper are demonstrated in this [demo notebook](Replicability%20(RQ2%20Res)/Replicability_Demo%20(RQ2%20results).ipynb). Also, all the results files that can be used to reproduce our results are provided in this [results folder](Replicability%20(RQ2%20Res)/).


## Insights Experiments

For the insights experiments, we also provide a demo [demo notebook](Insights%20(RQ3%20Res)/ColStar_SMP_Demo%20(RQ3%20Res).ipynb).
Or, instead of running the experiments from scratch, you can use our provided results files in this [results folder](Insights%20(RQ3%20Res)/) directly to reproduce our presented results.
